## Vocab Vortex
Vibrate verbs, vary vowels, numerate nouns, and alter adjectives in a brain-bending grammar gambit

There are two parts of the game, a native android app and a vert.x server component. The server computes word lists, saves progress, stats, and upgrades.


## Components

* [vocab-vortex](https://github.com/dulrich/vocab-vortex) is the server code
* [vocab-vortex-app](https://github.com/dulrich/vocab-vortex-app) is the android app code
